# Hi there, I'm Maximus Mukiza! üëã

I'm a passionate **Cloud & Cyber Security student** at Thomas More Geel, with 2 years of experience. I thrive on **automating cloud infrastructure**, driven by the goal of achieving easier and more cost-effective solutions compared to on-site setups. My current focus is deep diving into **cloud security and infrastructure**.
