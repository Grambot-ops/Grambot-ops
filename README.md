# Hi there, I'm Maximus Mukiza! üëã

I'm a **Cloud & Cyber Security student** at Thomas More Geel with 2 years of hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure and automation. I'm passionate about building secure, scalable solutions that make cloud deployments simpler and more cost-effective than traditional on-premises setups.


## üéØ What I'm Working On

**Currently building:** A secure, automated hosting platform for my studies that streamlines the deployment of client Git repositories with a focus on European compliance standards.

**Learning focus:** Advanced cloud security architectures, infrastructure hardening, and emerging threats in cloud environments.

**Collaboration interests:** Rust development projects, particularly those enhancing performance and security in low-level systems. As an LPI-certified professional, I'm excited about Rust's potential within the Linux ecosystem.
